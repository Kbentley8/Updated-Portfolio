# Updated-Portfolio Homework 7
In this assignment, I was tasked with updating my portfolio webpage with an updated resume, my project 1 assignment, two newer homework assignments, an updated LinkedIn profile. I created a list for my projects and added a link to the deployed site and git hub repository for each assigment. For this assignment, html and css were used.
